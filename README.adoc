= Service Registry sample

*Expedition* and *Camelboy* are example applications demonstrating the use of Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Service Registry product, please http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/[see the documentation].)

== Building and Deploying

. Build the two projects from the root (`greeting`) directory. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (OS X, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (if you used Maven, link:scripts/deploy_mvn.sh[`scripts/deploy_mvn.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_mvn.bat[`scripts/deploy_mvn.bat`]; if you used Gradle, link:scripts/deploy_gradle.sh[`scripts/deploy_gradle.sh`] or link:scripts/deploy_gradle.bat[`scripts/deploy_gradle.bat`]).
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy_gradle.sh
....
+
The script will create a Service Registry service instance and then push the applications and bind them to the service.

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]/hello`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the Camelboy application. The Camelboy application will use the Service Registry to look up the Expedition app and get a greeting message, which (to begin with) should be &#8220;Hello, camel boy!&#8221;

. You can see what the Expedition application is sending back by viewing its logs. Run `cf logs expedition`.
+
....
$ cf logs expedition

. To get a different greeting message, you can provide `salutation` and `name` parameters, as in `[ROUTE]/hello?salutation=Come%20on&name=Jesse`. The Camelboy application will send those parameters to the Expedition application and the resulting greeting will be customized to match.
